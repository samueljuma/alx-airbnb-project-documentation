# üìñ Understanding User Stories and Use Case Diagrams

## üß© What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end user. They focus on **what** a user needs and **why**, rather than **how** the functionality is implemented.

Each user story typically follows this format:

> **As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I can achieve a goal].**

### ‚ú® Example:
> *As a guest, I want to search for properties by location so that I can find accommodation that suits my travel plans.*

User stories are a core part of agile development. They guide:
- Feature prioritization
- Technical planning
- Testing (as acceptance criteria)

## üó∫Ô∏è What Is a Use Case Diagram?

A **use case diagram** is a **visual tool** used in software design to illustrate how different users (called actors) interact with a system. It shows:
- **Actors** (e.g., Guest, Host, Admin)
- **System use cases** (features or functions)
- **Relationships** between them

This helps identify what the system must support from a functional standpoint.

## üîó Relationship Between Use Case Diagrams and User Stories

The **use case diagram** is the **foundation** that feeds into the creation of **user stories**.

| Use Case Diagram | ‚Üí | User Stories |
|------------------|----|--------------|
| Visual overview of actors and actions | | Textual breakdown of features |
| Focuses on system scope | ‚Üí | Focuses on user perspective |
| Groups all interactions | | Describes specific interactions |
| Aids system modeling | | Aids agile planning and testing |

Every **use case** in the diagram should result in **one or more user stories**, which further clarify the functionality in practical, testable terms.
